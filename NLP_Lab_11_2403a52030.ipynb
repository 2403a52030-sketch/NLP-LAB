And Paul Ryan will never be president. Today proved it. \\nIn a particularly staggering example of political cowardice, Paul Ryan re-re-re-reversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all. This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago. He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. Suddenly, Ryan was appearing at a pro-Trump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States. It was a surreal moment. The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline, got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin, and lit a match. . @SpeakerRyan says he voted for @realDonaldTrump : \\u201cRepublicans, it is time to come home\\u201d https://t.co/VyTT49YvoE pic.twitter.com/wCvSCg4a5I \\n\\u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 5, 2016 \\nThe Democratic Party couldn\\u2019t have asked for a better moment of film. Ryan\\u2019s chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant. In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake, those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover. If Ryan\\u2019s career manages to limp all the way to 2020, then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day. \\nThe ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness. Ryan has postured himself as a \\u201cprincipled\\u201d conservative, and one uncomfortable with Trump\\u2019s unapologetic bigotry and sexism. However, when push came to shove, Paul Ryan \\u2013 like many of his colleagues \\u2013 turned into a sniveling appeaser. After all his lofty tak about conviction, his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze. \\nWhat\\u2019s especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed. For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all. His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down, pretend Trump didn\\u2019t exist, and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016. Now, just days away from the election, he screwed it all up. \\nIf 2016\\u2019s very ugly election has done any good it\\u2019s by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage. A reality television star spit on them, hijacked their party, insulted their wives, and got every last one of them to kneel before him. What a turn of events. \\nFeatured image via Twitter\",\n          \"It's primary day in New York and front-runners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are leading in the polls.\\n\\nTrump is now vowing to win enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination and prevent a contested convention. But Sens.Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., and Ohio Gov. John Kasich and aren't giving up just yet.\\n\\nA big win in New York could tip the scales for both the Republican and Democratic front-runners in this year's race for the White House. Clinton and Trump have each suffered losses in recent contests, shifting the momentum to their rivals.\\n\\n\\\"We have won eight out of the last nine caucuses and primaries! Cheer!\\\" Sanders recently told supporters.\\n\\nWhile wins in New York for Trump and Clinton are expected, the margins of those victories are also important.\\n\\nTrump needs to capture more than 50 percent of the vote statewide if he wants to be positioned to win all of the state's 95 GOP delegates. That would put him one step closer to avoiding a contested convention.\\n\\n\\\"We've got to vote and you know Cruz is way, way down in the polls,\\\" Trump urged supporters.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Sanders is hoping for a close race in the Empire State. A loss by 10 points means he'll need to win 80 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination.\\n\\nDespite a predicted loss in New York, Cruz hasn't lost momentum. He's hoping to sweep up more delegates this weekend while he's talking about how he can win in November.\\n\\n\\\"Because if I'm the nominee, we win the General Election,\\\" Cruz promised his supporters. \\\"We're beating Hillary in the key swing states, we're beating Hillary with Independents, we're beating Hillary with young people.\\\"\\n\\nFor now, Cruz, Kasich, and Sanders have all moved on from New York to other states. Trump and Clinton are the only two staying in their home state to watch the results come in.\",\n          \"U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday\\u2019s unity march against terrorism.\\n\\nKerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.\\n\\nThe visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.\\n\\nThe French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday\\u2019s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.\\n\\nAmong roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.\\n\\nKerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India\\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi\\u2019s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.\\n\\nIn a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as \\u201cquibbling a little bit.\\u201d He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.\\n\\n\\u201cBut that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,\\u201d he said.\\n\\n\\u201cAnd I don\\u2019t think the people of France have any doubts about America\\u2019s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"REAL\",\n          \"FAKE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

And Paul Ryan will never be president. Today proved it. \\nIn a particularly staggering example of political cowardice, Paul Ryan re-re-re-reversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all. This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago. He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. Suddenly, Ryan was appearing at a pro-Trump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States. It was a surreal moment. The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline, got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin, and lit a match. . @SpeakerRyan says he voted for @realDonaldTrump : \\u201cRepublicans, it is time to come home\\u201d https://t.co/VyTT49YvoE pic.twitter.com/wCvSCg4a5I \\n\\u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 5, 2016 \\nThe Democratic Party couldn\\u2019t have asked for a better moment of film. Ryan\\u2019s chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant. In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake, those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover. If Ryan\\u2019s career manages to limp all the way to 2020, then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day. \\nThe ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness. Ryan has postured himself as a \\u201cprincipled\\u201d conservative, and one uncomfortable with Trump\\u2019s unapologetic bigotry and sexism. However, when push came to shove, Paul Ryan \\u2013 like many of his colleagues \\u2013 turned into a sniveling appeaser. After all his lofty tak about conviction, his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze. \\nWhat\\u2019s especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed. For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all. His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down, pretend Trump didn\\u2019t exist, and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016. Now, just days away from the election, he screwed it all up. \\nIf 2016\\u2019s very ugly election has done any good it\\u2019s by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage. A reality television star spit on them, hijacked their party, insulted their wives, and got every last one of them to kneel before him. What a turn of events. \\nFeatured image via Twitter\",\n          \"It's primary day in New York and front-runners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are leading in the polls.\\n\\nTrump is now vowing to win enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination and prevent a contested convention. But Sens.Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., and Ohio Gov. John Kasich and aren't giving up just yet.\\n\\nA big win in New York could tip the scales for both the Republican and Democratic front-runners in this year's race for the White House. Clinton and Trump have each suffered losses in recent contests, shifting the momentum to their rivals.\\n\\n\\\"We have won eight out of the last nine caucuses and primaries! Cheer!\\\" Sanders recently told supporters.\\n\\nWhile wins in New York for Trump and Clinton are expected, the margins of those victories are also important.\\n\\nTrump needs to capture more than 50 percent of the vote statewide if he wants to be positioned to win all of the state's 95 GOP delegates. That would put him one step closer to avoiding a contested convention.\\n\\n\\\"We've got to vote and you know Cruz is way, way down in the polls,\\\" Trump urged supporters.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Sanders is hoping for a close race in the Empire State. A loss by 10 points means he'll need to win 80 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination.\\n\\nDespite a predicted loss in New York, Cruz hasn't lost momentum. He's hoping to sweep up more delegates this weekend while he's talking about how he can win in November.\\n\\n\\\"Because if I'm the nominee, we win the General Election,\\\" Cruz promised his supporters. \\\"We're beating Hillary in the key swing states, we're beating Hillary with Independents, we're beating Hillary with young people.\\\"\\n\\nFor now, Cruz, Kasich, and Sanders have all moved on from New York to other states. Trump and Clinton are the only two staying in their home state to watch the results come in.\",\n          \"U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday\\u2019s unity march against terrorism.\\n\\nKerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.\\n\\nThe visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.\\n\\nThe French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday\\u2019s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.\\n\\nAmong roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.\\n\\nKerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India\\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi\\u2019s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.\\n\\nIn a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as \\u201cquibbling a little bit.\\u201d He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.\\n\\n\\u201cBut that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,\\u201d he said.\\n\\n\\u201cAnd I don\\u2019t think the people of France have any doubts about America\\u2019s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":
